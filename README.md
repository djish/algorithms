## Space complexity

Total amount of computer memory required by an algorthm to complete its execution. 

Memory is used in 4 different aspcts:

1. To Store program instructions
1. To store constant values
1. To stroe variable values
1. Functions, Go to references etc. 

Program uses computer memory for three reasons:

1. Instruction Space: Store compiled instructions
1. Environmental Stack: Store information on partially executed functions
1. Data Space: Store variables and constants
